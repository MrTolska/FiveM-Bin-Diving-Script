**Usage:**  
- Walk up to a dumpster and press the prompt key to grab a bin bag.

- Track your scavenging reputation using `/binrep`.

**Loot System:**  
- Items are rolled based on configured chance and tier.  
- Reputation increases chance for higher tier loot.  
- Can be configured for single or multiple item rolls.
