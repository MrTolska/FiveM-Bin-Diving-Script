# vx_bins (ox_lib UI + Rep) — /binrep

What's new:
- Added **/binrep** chat command to show your current scavenging rep (no keybind).

Usage:
- `/binrep` → shows "Scav rep: <value>" via ox_lib notify.

Everything else is unchanged from the previous build:
- Grab bag from dumpster (ox_target) → hold bag.
- While holding: **E** to search, **G** to discard.
- Rep in QBCore metadata; 5% chance to gain on successful search.
- Higher rep boosts higher-tier loot drop chances.
